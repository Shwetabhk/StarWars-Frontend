# StarWars-Frontend

Hosted on Heroku :
    
      https://evening-garden-80719.herokuapp.com/

A simple django app that lets us view/favourite Star Wars data. The app:

    · Loads planets and movies from the JSON API provided by https://swapi.co/

    · Supports support searching by planet by:

        o   Title

    · Lists Movies/Planets showing:

          o   Title

          o   Image (if present)

          o   Add Button

    · Allows saving of planets to a local store or service using the Add Button (changes are saved temporarily
    as the app is hosted on heroku)

    · Lists SavedTitle showing Title/Image
